"""
For a program that should run only as long as many conditions are true,
you can define one variable that determines whether or not the entire program
is active
This variable, called a flag, acts as a signal to the program. We
can write our programs so they run while the flag is set to True and stop running
when any of several events sets the value of the flag to False
